It doesn't matter if you are a Yanky in King Arthur's court or Biff who just stole Marty's time machine, or if some virus just destroyed the world and you need to rebuild. This app will give you all the knowledge you need to survive.

(best if paired with a solar charger)

The initial interface should ask:

1) Time Travel or apocalypse?

1a) if Time Travel Continue down questions
1b) if Apocalypse go stratight to index of articles



2) Do you know when you are?

2a) if so when?
2b) if in the future "sorry charlie, we can't help"
2c) if not, a guide to figure out out when you are


once when is configured we can index all articles based on when.


3) Do you know where you are?



4) Do you know what language is being spoken around you?

4a) if so some basic phrases to help muddle through, and a language translation dictionary for the rest

4b) if not a guide and tools to help you disern the langauge, maybe some prerecorded messags that say "help, I'm a lost traveler and this is all I know how to say"



Once you've gotten into the app, we should have indexed all the articles we need to know for you including when the next eclipse is for your location, what the sportings scores are in coming events, what election results are about to happen, what weather patterns are about to happen, and what patents are about to be influential and any other how to articles we feel are relivent. Maybe a breif description of the time and place you have landed.

This could be a fun community project to build out.
